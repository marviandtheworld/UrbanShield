# üó∫Ô∏è React Native Maps Module Fix

## ‚úÖ Problem Identified

The error `turbo module registry get enforcing... rnmapsairmodule could not be found` indicates that `react-native-maps` is not properly linked or you're using Expo Go which doesn't support native modules.

## üîß Solutions by Platform

### **Solution 1: For Expo Development Build**

If you're using Expo with a development build (not Expo Go):

```bash
# 1. Install the module
npx expo install react-native-maps

# 2. Create development build
npx expo run:android
# or
npx expo run:ios

# 3. For web, use the fallback (already implemented)
```

### **Solution 2: For Expo Go (Recommended)**

Since Expo Go doesn't support native modules, use the web fallback:

```bash
# 1. Start with web fallback
npx expo start --web

# 2. The app will automatically use WebMapFallback on web
# 3. For mobile, you'll need a development build
```

### **Solution 3: For Bare React Native**

If you're using bare React Native:

```bash
# 1. Install the module
npm install react-native-maps

# 2. Link the module (React Native 0.60+)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# 3. For Android, add to android/app/build.gradle:
# implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:18.0.2'
```
